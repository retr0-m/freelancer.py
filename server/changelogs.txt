SERVER VERSION - 1.5.2
- added in config.py a list of customers_type and customers_city, so each time no leads were found of a type in a city, it changes the type, and if it runs out of types, it searches in another city, like 2 base 15 chars aa ab ac ... ba bb bc ... ca cc cd
- created lead_pipeline_manager.py -> will manage the pipeline for creating a new website for a new lead.

SERVER VERSION - 1.5.1
- server_human_approval manages the connections between the client on the web, and how the program reacts after a certain input, using uvicorn and fastapi for performance and semplicity reasons.
- improved many functions to work with server.py ( create_documentation.py - create_website.py - database.py - edit_website.py - find_customers.py - ftp_manager.py - imgs_description.py - lead.py - log.py - qr_generator.py)

SERVER VERSION - 1.4.1
- added config.py, a file having all the constants that many scripts use.


SERVER VERSION - 1.3.1
- added image_description.py -> using ollama llava:7b to give images a description to improve the website creation


SERVER VERSION - 1.4.1
- created server.py -> script that allows the program to fully autonomously run in separated thread (2-3).




In a nutshell, the server version its just to make all run all the time, and let me (or the user) manage how the program is working, from my phone, i just enter the ip of my pc, and i can approve a lead or unapprove it, so when i do one of those operations automatically, another lead is created so there are always 10 leads on the page.
