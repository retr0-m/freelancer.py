- In a nutshell, the server version its just to make all run all the time, and let me (or the user) manage how the program is working, from my phone, i just enter the ip of my pc, and i can approve a lead or unapprove it, so when i do one of those operations automatically, another lead is created so there are always 10 leads on the page.
